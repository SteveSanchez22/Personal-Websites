## Prototype 

During the prototype stage, I used several tools to get to my final website design iteration. It initially started with a piece of paper and pen, sketching and outlining some ideas which consisted of shapes, outlining where things should go.

Following this primitive prototype stage, I then moved on to using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to create a wireframe which gave me a basic layout and structural guideline of the website User Interface.

Figma enabled me to move and manipulate sections of the wireframe, understanding the flow the user would take enabled me to make the decision of the order and structure of the website.

Finally, this lead to the final prototype iteration, it is an advanced wireframe with more visual detail and interaction, used for developing the website.

## Questions to ask myself 

-	Who are your users?
    - Who’s going to use the website?

-	What do they expect?
    - What do they expect to be able to experience, read or interact 

-	Why do those things matter to them?
    - Why is it important that they’re able to see this?
    - Or they way they interact with something in a particular way?
